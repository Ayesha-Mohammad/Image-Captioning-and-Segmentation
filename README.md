The project uses Pytorch and the MS COCO dataset for training. COCO is a large image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, person keypoints detection, stuff segmentation, and caption generation. The dataset contains images with 5 pre-made captions each. The large majority of these captions are between 8 to 15 words long.
